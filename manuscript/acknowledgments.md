# Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank two people in particular for their advice and ideas. [Annette Jensen][annette-linkedin], the director of software development at [Widen][widen], gave me the initial idea to turn my blog posts into this book. Without her insight, "Beyond jQuery" would not exist. [Matthew Gonnering][matthew-video] offered quite a bit of guidance and advice on publishing and procedural decisions. He also was more than willing to listen to me gripe about the stress associated with writing a book, and provided a great amount of feedback that allowed me to better pursue my goals as a writer. [Widen (my employer)][widen] has contributed by [providing a free environment][widen-worldblu] where developers can be creative, productive, and happy in their pursuit of developing amazingly innovative marketing technology. Thank you to everyone who has assisted me in my work.
