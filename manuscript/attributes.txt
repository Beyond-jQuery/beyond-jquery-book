# Using and Understanding HTML Element Attributes {#element-attributes}

Here in chapter five, prepare yourself for a full-scale, in-depth, no-holds-barred discussion on everything related to element attributes. All that you learned in the ["finding elements" chapter](#finding-elements) will prove to be useful as I will need to build on some of this knowledge in an effort to help you discover attributes. Here, I'll be sure you have a [proper understanding of attributes](#what-are-attributes), as well [how they came about and became part of HTML, and how they fit into the web API](#attribute-history). Additionally, you'll learn how to [use attributes to locate DOM elements](#finding-elements-with-attributes). While this was covered a bit in the ["finding elements" chapter](#finding-elements), you'll find that the coverage _here_ is comprehensive. And finally, I'll dive deeper into attributes and cover how you can [read, add, and update them on any DOM element](#reading-attributes). Special sections on [`data-`](#data-attributes), [`style`](#style-attribute), and [`class`](#class-attributes) attributes will be included as well.

Other than two exceptions, all of the web API code in this chapter has full support across _all_ [modern browsers](#modern-browsers) _and_ even Internet Explorer 8. And for those couple that do not have wide browser support, there is an equally elegant solution available for one, and a relatively straightforward approach for the other. After you complete this chapter, you will not only have a complete understanding of attributes, but you will also have the confidence to read, update, and use them to select elements all browsers, even those as old as Internet Explorer 8. Read on to continue your quest to move beyond jQuery.


## What is an attribute? {#what-are-attributes}

HTML elements, declaratively speaking, are made up of three parts: name, content, and attributes, with the last two being optional. Take a look at the following simple fragment, which I'll reference as I explain these three parts a bit more.

{title="html tags are made up of three parts", lang=html}
~~~~~~~
<form action="/rest/login.php" method="POST">
   <input name="username" required>
   <input type="password" name="password" required>
</form>
~~~~~~~

In the above markup, you see three elements: one `<form>` and two `<input>`s. The `<form>` element has a tag name of "form". In fact, `tagName` is a property available on every object in the DOM that implements the `Element` interface. This property was [standardized as part of W3C's DOM Level 2 Core specification][element.tagname]. In my above HTML, the `<form>` element, represented as a [`HTMLFormElement` object][html5-form], has a `tagName` of "form". The two `<input>` elements are represented as [`HTMLInputElement` objects][html5-input], and unsurprisingly they have `tagName` values of "input".
   
Content describes any other node that are are descendants of an element. My example `<form>` has two `<input>` elements as content, while the two `<input>` elements have _no_ content. In fact, `<input>` elements are not allowed to have any content. This restriction was likely in place since `<input>` elements were first introduced in [the HTML 2 specification][html2], but was only first [explicitly mentioned in the HTML 3 official standard document][html3].
   
I> ## A note about my form example markup
I>
I> Normally you would want to associate each form field with a `<label>` and a text node with a display name. Also, a submit button is usually prudent, but I left all of these out of my fragment to keep it simple and focused on the discussion of attributes.

Attributes, also optional, provide a way to annotate elements directly in your markup. You may use them to provide data or state. For example, the `<form>` element above contains two such attributes: `action` and `method`, which together tell the form to send a POST request (`method`) to the "/rest/login.php" server endpoint (`action`) when the form is submitted. The first input has a `name` attribute of "username" and the second has a `name` of "password". This information is used to construct the request and tie these elements to their values when the server parses the form submit. This is not evident in the above HTML, but you can even create your own proprietary attributes and reference them in your code for the purposes of associating state or data with elements in your markup. Though not strictly required, the more standard way to do this is with `data-` attributes, which [will be discussed later on in this chapter](#data-attributes).
   
In addition to providing data or state, some attributes are used to define specific behaviors for a more general element. Take a look at the `type` attribute on the second input in the above fragment, as an example of this. This `type` attribute defines the second input to be a password input, which signals the browser to mask any characters entered into this field by the user. The first input _could_ include a `type` attribute with a value of "text", but this is not necessary as all `<input>` elements are, by default, text inputs. This default has been in place since the inception of HTML, and [is visible in one of the earliest drafts of the specification][html1-input]. Another example of a behavior imposed by an attribute can be seen on both of the inputs above. Notice the `required` attributes on each of the inputs - this is a signal to any browser that supports [the `constraints API`][html5-constraints] to prevent form submission if either of these fields are left empty by the user. 


### History and standardization {#attribute-history}

Attributes have always been a part of HTML, and were [described in the first document that details HTML tags][html-tags], written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992. In this article, Berners-Lee describes the same two general types of attributes that are used in HTML today  - boolean, and variable - which I will elaborate on further shortly. The passage that calls out attributes is near the start of the document:

> Some tags take parameters, called attributes. The attributes are given after the tag, separated by spaces. Certain attributes have an effect simply by their presence, others are followed by an equals sign and a value.

Berners-Lee went on to mention a few such attributes, using the `href`, `type`, and `name` attributes of anchor tags as an example. Note though that the `name` attribute on `<a>` elements is no longer available as [it was removed in the HTML5 specification][html5-anchor]. Since this first description of HTML, the number and importance of element attributes has increased greatly.

Purely custom attributes are not, and have never been _officially_ supported in any HTML specification. But you may prefix an attribute name of your choice with "data-" as of the HTML5 spec - more on that [later](#data-attributes). However, if you would like to introduce a purely custom attribute into your markup, such as "myproject-uuid", you are certainly free to do so. The page will render without issue, and there will be no errors in your browser's developer tools console. Everything will work just fine. The only drawback is that your document will fail validation, as it will contain non-standard attributes, that is, attributes that are not mentioned in any accepted HTML standard. In fact, non-standard custom attributes are quite common, and even quite prevalent in popular JavaScript frameworks, such as AngularJS, which relies on non-standard custom attributes heavily to facilitate communication between element directives.

The latest _completed_ HTML spec - HTML5 - defines [four different types of attributes][html5-attribute-styntax]. One type commonly known as a ["boolean attribute"][html5-boolean-attribute] is expressed as an element attribute without any value. Take the `required` attribute commonly found on `<input>` elements as one example (seen in the [previous section's](#what-are-attributes) HTML fragment). As the specification states, "The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value." The HTML 5.1 standardized [`hidden` attribute][html51-hidden], which instructs the browser to _not_ render any element bearing the attribute, is another example of this first type.

A second type of attribute is described as "unquoted". A little known fact is that you may omit quotes around your attribute values, provided the attribute value does not contain spaces, equal signs, or angle brackets (`<` and `>`), or an empty string (among other less notable character restrictions). So, the HTML fragment in the previous section can be re-written as follows:

{title="unquoted attributes are perfectly legal", lang=html}
~~~~~~~
<form action=/rest/login.php method=POST>
   <input name=username required>
   <input type=password name=password required>
</form>
~~~~~~~

The final two types of HTML element attributes are very similar: single-quoted and double-quoted. Both are similar in that they largely have the same restrictions, and are much more common than unquoted attributes. Though, double-quoted attributes are arguably the _most_ common of all types. In contrast to unquoted attribute values, those that are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks _may_ contain spaces, equal signs, angle brackets, or an empty string. The portion of the latest W3C specification that describes attributes only may never contain any ambiguous ampersand characters, that is, an `&` sign followed by ASCII characters and terminated with a semicolon (`;`) where the character code does _not_ match any character codes defined in the [named character references][html5-named-character-references] portion of the spec.

### The power of wildcard and fuzzy attribute selectors

%% Browser support via querySelector - IE8+

%%- [att|=val]
%%Represents an element with the att attribute, its value either being exactly "val" or beginning with "val" immediately followed by "-" (U+002D). This is primarily intended to allow language subcode matches (e.g., the hreflang attribute on the a element in HTML) as described in BCP 47 ([BCP47]) or its successor. For lang (or xml:lang) language subcode matching, please see the :lang pseudo-class.

%% -[att^=val]
%%Represents an element with the att attribute whose value begins with the prefix "val". If "val" is the empty string then the selector does not represent anything.

%%- [att$=val]
%%Represents an element with the att attribute whose value ends with the suffix "val". If "val" is the empty string then the selector does not represent anything.

%%- [att*=val]
%%Represents an element with the att attribute whose value contains at least one instance of the substring "val". If "val" is the empty string then the selector does not represent anything.


## Reading and modifying element attributes {#reading-attributes}
